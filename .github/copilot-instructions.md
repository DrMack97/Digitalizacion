# Copilot Instructions for Digitalizacion

## Project Overview
This repository appears to be an educational or introductory Python project. The main script (`A1/Actividad1.py`) demonstrates basic Python syntax, variable types, and conditional logic.

## Directory Structure
- `A1/Actividad1.py`: Main Python script. Contains simple print statements, variable assignments, type checks, and a conditional block.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: (This file) Guidance for AI coding agents.

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- Scripts are placed in subdirectories (e.g., `A1/`).
- Code is written in Spanish (e.g., variable names, strings, and comments if present).
- Use of basic Python features: print, type checking, and if statements.
- No external dependencies or requirements files detected.

## Developer Workflows
- **Run the script:**
  ```powershell
  python A1/Actividad1.py
  ```
- No build, test, or CI/CD workflows are present.
- No custom project-specific commands or tools are required.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Maintain the use of Spanish for variable names, strings, and comments.
- Keep code simple and beginner-friendly, as the project appears educational.
- Place new scripts in appropriately named subdirectories if expanding the project.
- If adding new features, follow the style and simplicity of `Actividad1.py`.
- No special integration points or cross-component communication patterns exist at this stage.

## Example Pattern
```python
# Variable assignment and type checking
a = 10
print(type(a))

# Conditional logic
if a > 5:
    print("Mayor que cinco")
```
